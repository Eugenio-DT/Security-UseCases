## How to Use This Repository

Each use-case is documented with:
- A high-level summary of what it aims at demonstrate and achieve
- The benefits provided by the solution approach using Dynatrace
- A step-by-step guidance on how to setup the environment and reproduce the use-case

Feel free to explore each section to learn how Dynatrace can be utilized to address specific security challenges and improve your organization's security posture.

## Core Security Domains

Security use-cases are organized by core security domains, each focusing on different security areas and aspects:

<br>

### 1. DevSecOps and Secure SDLC Management

In this section, we explore how Dynatrace integrates and secures the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), by embedding security controls within the CI/CD pipelines. These use-cases focus on ensuring that security is an integrated aspect of the DevOps process, preventing vulnerable applications from going into production. Topics covered include security gates, automated vulnerability scans, and compliance checks within CI/CD.  
Check out the [DevSecOps and Secure SDLC Management](/core-security-domains/DevSecOps%20and%20Secure%20SDLC%20Management/README.md) section, for further details including all the resources and guides to spin-up the use-cases.

### 2. Vulnerability Management

This area focuses on the discovery, assessment, and management of vulnerabilities across applications and services. Use-cases demonstrate how Dynatrace identifies vulnerabilities in running code, evaluates their potential impact, and provides actionable insights to remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. It also highlights automation in tracking and responding to new security findings.

### 3. Threat Hunting and Forensics

Here, we dive into how Dynatrace can help perform in-depth security investigations. Use-cases detail leveraging Dynatrace's observability data to trace security incidents, pinpoint the root cause of breaches, and understand the attack path. This section aims to provide insights into how forensic data can be used to learn from incidents and prevent recurrence.

### 4. Threat Detection and Response

This section includes use-cases on detecting and responding to active threats in real-time. Using Dynatrace's AI-powered threat detection capabilities, these use-cases demonstrate how to identify suspicious activity, detect abnormal patterns, and automate responses to mitigate attacks quickly. Topics include behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, and leveraging real-time monitoring to enhance security visibility.

### 5. Security Posture Management (Coming Soon)

This section focuses on ensuring that your cloud and Kubernetes environments maintain a robust security posture. Topics covered include Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM). Use-cases demonstrate how Dynatrace can be utilized to continuously monitor configurations, detect misconfigurations, and ensure compliance with security standards to prevent vulnerabilities before they become exploitable.
